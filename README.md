# Moonlight Android

[![Travis CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android)

[Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org) is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield.
We reverse engineered the Shield streaming software and created a version that can be run on any Android device.

Moonlight will allow you to stream your full collection of games from your Windows PC to your Android device,
whether in your own home or over the internet.

Check our [wiki](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-docs/wiki) for more detailed information or a troubleshooting guide.

Moonlight is the work of students at [Case Western](http://case.edu) and was
started as a project at [MHacks](http://mhacks.org).

做了一部分更改:
*添加快速投射桌面按钮(默认程序名mstsc)
*当投射程序名为mstsc时,,一旦推流页onStop,直接关闭推流
*在判断是否游戏控制器时,将非字母键盘和字母键盘都改为非手柄,以防止M3遥控器的返回键被吞
